üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Greetings! I'm Jeremy (or jb), a fellow learner and a geek at heart, and I've been working in software solution development for over 25 years! I have worked in many industries including health, idea and innovation management, Federal government (HHS, DOD, DOJ, etc.), e-Commerce, and others. I tend to play roles that leverage my ability to bring together strategy and implementation, business and technology, as I seem to be able to speak the languages of both sets of stakeholders, and tailor communication appropriately.


I'm passionate about how people, process, and technology come together and bring solutions to life. I'm really interested in how teams and individuals deliver amazing solutions, how they continuously develop themselves, and how organizational cultures adapt to remain empathetic to the challenges and realities of their teams as business priorities and strategies evolve over time. I'm a believer in psychological safety, and embrace the idea that creating an environment where pepole can be open and be themsevlves will provide the best outcomes all around.


I'm also fascinated by the ever changing technical landscape we work in, and how we make the best decisions we can to apply technology to problems in the most appropriate, scalable, and adaptable ways. While my day to day activities are often not hands-on coding, I still enjoy coding small projects whether in my professional roles or for personal projects, just to stay as current as I can and keep learning.


üöÄ Expertise Highlights

Collaborator and Relationship Builder | I strongly believe in partnerships, whether within my own team and organization, customers, vendors, or other partners. I work openly, I like to know people and their interests as well as their strengths and what makes them tick. I think this helps organize teams to be their most effective, and to empower people in their roles. 


Strategic Architecture | Crafting solutions that seamlessly merge strategy and implementation, with a focus on usability, quality, and scalability. Maintaining vision throughout development and delivery. 

Polyglot Technologist | With a strong fluency in .NET I have also done professional work in Java, Python, React, and many others. With my background in consulting and services I've made a career of being able to jump into a new business and technology and bring best practices, experience, and problem solving to rapidly adapt and deliver value.

DevOps and Development: I believe these go together and are based in a collaborative and open culture. From pipelines to automation, I thrive in the DevOps playground, ensuring seamless delivery from code to deployment.

üìö Passion for Learning
I don't just adapt; I evolve. My code journey is a perpetual quest for knowledge. Constantly diving into new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies, I thrive in the ever-changing landscape of software development.

üå± Mentorship & Growth Advocate
Believing in the power of shared knowledge, I am not just a leader but a mentor. Passionate about fostering a culture of growth, I dedicate time to coaching and empowering individuals to reach their full potential.

ü§ù Collaboration & Psychological Safety Advocate
Collaboration isn't just a buzzword; it's the heartbeat of success. I champion the belief that great ideas flourish in an environment of psychological safety. Team synergy is my mantra, and I ensure every voice is heard.

üí° I'm your strategic partner, the mastermind who sits down with leadership, decoding their objectives and ensuring that every step taken aligns with the grand vision. It's not just about problem-solving; it's about foreseeing challenges and turning them into stepping stones towards success.

ü§ù Collaboration isn't just a buzzword for me; it's a way of life. In the dynamic dance of cross-functional teams, I take the lead, designing scalable systems that aren't just robust but adaptable, embracing the ever-shifting goals of the business landscape.

üåü But it's not just about systems and strategies; I'm a virtuoso in building relationships. Stakeholders and partners aren't just entities; they're allies in the pursuit of overall quality and excellence. I transform collaboration into a symphony of success where every note resonates with quality and brilliance.

üåê Let's Code the Future Together
Join me in this code odyssey, where strategy meets implementation, learning is a perpetual adventure, and collaboration is the key to unlocking unprecedented success. Together, let's shape the future of software development! üöÄüåü
